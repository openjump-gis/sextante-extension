This algorithms incorporates three of them:  &#10;*Paralelepiped &#10;*Minimum distance &#10;*Maximum likelihood  &#10;The user should check which of the algorithms produces the best classification of the image (this depends on the training areas as well as the characteristics of the images itself).  In the paralelepiped algorithm, some cells might not be classified (they will be asigned the no data value) if their signature is not similar to any of those defined by the training areas. The other algorithms will always classify a pixel into a given class." description="Method" type="3">
