		<element name="DESCRIPTION" text="This algorithm allows the user to know the difference between its flow input and the flow output, considering its hydrological structure. A given number of cells situated upslope and in the immediate surrounding of a specific cell flow onto it. At the same time, the flow of this cell flows onto one (or various depending on the model used) cell situated downhill. Analysing the difference between these values, the so called net balance is obtained." description="Description" type="0">

For this, the directions of flow are limited in multiple angles of  45&#186;, which makes this method inconvinient. (O'Callaghan &amp; Mark 1984).&#10;* DInfinity: the flow goes from the center of one cell up to the center of two contiguous cells  around it,  for which it is considered a bidimensional flow and overcome in this way the deficiency of  D8. (Tarboton 1998).&#10;* MFD (Multiple Flow Direction): a method that considers a flow bidimensional (Multiple Flow Direction Algorithms.)" description="Method" type="3">
