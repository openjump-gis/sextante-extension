<P>
Every time you execute a SEXTANTE algorithm, information about the process is stored in the SEXTANTE history manager. Along with the parameters used, the date and time of the execution are also saved.

<P>
This way, it is easy to track the and control all the work that has been developed using SEXTANTE, and easily reproduce it.

<P>
The SEXTANTE history manager is a set of registries grouped according to their date of execution, making it easier to find information about an algorithm executed at any particular moment.

<P>
Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those learning how to use the command-lin interface, since they can call an algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how that same algorithm could be called from the command line.

<P>
Apart from browsing the entries in the registry, processes can be re-executed, simply double-clicking on the corresponding entry.

<P>
You can also right click on a process (the command-line sentence must start with ``runalg'') and select <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Open algorithm dialog</SPAN>. This will show the dialog used to execute the algorithm, already filled with the parameter values corresponding to the selected command.
