		<element name="DESCRIPTION" text='This algorithm checks that lines comprised of multiple independent geometries are correctly defined, having all of them the same direction.&#10;&#10;Given a tolerance, the algorithm understand that lines with extreme points at a distance less than that tolerance represent segments of the same part. It then checks that they have the same direction (that is, the two points at a distance less than the tolerance are the ending one of the first line and the starting one of the second line) and if not, reverses the second one to make them match.&#10;&#10;This process start on a line representing a boundary segment (linked to other lines just on one of its extremes) and advances along the line, reversing lines as needed.&#10;&#10;Point in lines are not moved. If you want to do so and create a continuous line (reducing the distance between extreme points from the current distance lower than the tolerance to zero), use the "join adjacent lines" algorithm.&#10;&#10;The following picture shows an input layer (on top) and the resulting layer (bottom). Red points indicate starting point, while ending ones are represented in black.&#10;&#10;' description="Description" type="0">
