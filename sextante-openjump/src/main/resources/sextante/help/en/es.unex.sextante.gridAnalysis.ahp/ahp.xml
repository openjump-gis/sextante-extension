This algorithm uses the input layers and a table with a number of factors (equal to the number of layers), comparing their comparative weights to calculate a new layer as a linear combination  of the input layers.

It is recommended that these values  are established between 1 and 9 according on the following rules:&#10;* 1 = The same importance&#10;* 3 = Moderate predominance of one value over another&#10;* 5 = Strong predominance&#10;* 7 = Very Strong Predominance&#10;* 9 = Extreme Predominance&#10;* 2, 4, 6, 8 = Intermediate Values" description="Pairwise comparisons" type="3">
