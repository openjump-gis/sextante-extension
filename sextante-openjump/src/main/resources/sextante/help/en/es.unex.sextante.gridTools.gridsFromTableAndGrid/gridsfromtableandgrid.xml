		<element name="DESCRIPTION" text="This algorithms creates a set of raster layers from a classified grid and an alphanumeric table. The algorithm generates n-1 raster layers, n being the number of fields in the input table&#10;&#10;The algorithm works as follow: a field in the table is used as the class field, which identifies each one of the classes. For each cell in the input layer, the algorithm looks in the table and tries to find a record with that same value. If that value is found, the values associated with that record will be assigned to that same cell in the layer representing the variable in each one of the fields." description="Description" type="0">
