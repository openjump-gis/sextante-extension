		<element name="DESCRIPTION" text="Given a set of contour lines, this algorithms creates a vector layer which represents watersheds in the given area.&#10;&#10;Watersheds are calculated from a channel network previously extracted from a Digital Elevation Model. A threshold value is required to extract the channel network. Larger values of this threshold will result in a lower number of streams and, thus, a lower number of watersheds.&#10;&#10;Once watersheds are calculated, their geometric properties (area, perimeter...) are added to the attributes table of the resulting layer" description="Description" type="0">
